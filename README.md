## Introduction & Reasoning
A Chip 8 Emulaltor written in C++. SDL was used to handle the graphics. Emulation has been an interest of mine for a little bit so after getting my feet wet with the chip 8, I plan on moving onto the Nintendo Gameboy.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile the project simply run `make` in the target directory. You can also run the `make clean` command to automatically delete all the intermediate object files if you wish.

To run the emulator simply run `./chip8 /path/to/rom/file` in your terminal emulator.
